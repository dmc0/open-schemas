I was prompted to create this schema after reading about music artists complaining that they don't get paid precisely by the people who are listening to their songs.  Streaming services pay artists based on a system that favors the higher number of repeat plays that popular artists get.  This schema solves that by allowing precise reporting based on who streams a song, their subscription payment, whether or not they are on a free tier, the country's exchange rate for that day, etc.

I created the whole schema in about 4 hours.  I doubt it's perfect but I plan to revisit it at some point and a script to populate it with test data and add some queries to serve as the basis for individual artist revenue reports based ONLY on the people who have actually listened to their music.
